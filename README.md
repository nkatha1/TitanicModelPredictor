# Titanic Model Predictor 🛳️🔮

Welcome to the Titanic Model Predictor project! This machine learning model predicts the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic based on various features like age, gender, class, and more. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle, which has been cleaned and analyzed to build a predictive model using popular R packages like `ggplot2` and `caret`.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the famous Titanic dataset and develop a predictive model that can classify whether a passenger survived or not based on their attributes. By applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project aims to demonstrate the power of data science in solving real-world problems.

### 📊 Key Features:
- **Data Analysis**: Data exploration and visualizations using `ggplot2`.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
- **Modeling**: Training a classification model with `caret`.
- **Evaluation**: Using various performance metrics to evaluate the model's accuracy.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- **R**: The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **ggplot2**: For creating insightful and beautiful visualizations.
- **Caret**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Titanic Dataset**: The dataset used for building and training the predictive model.

## 🔧 Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nkatha1/TitanicModelPredictor.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
cd TitanicModelPredictor
Install required R packages:

r
Copy
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "caret"))
Open the R script file and run the analysis!

🏁 Getting Started
Once you have cloned the repository and installed the necessary dependencies, you can open the R script files to see the full data analysis and modeling process. You can explore the following:

Data exploration and preprocessing (for cleaning and transforming the data)
Data visualization (to understand patterns)
Model building and prediction (to train and test the machine learning model)
Example Usage:
r
Copy
# Example: Loading the Titanic data
titanic_data <- read.csv("train.csv")

# Example: Create a bar graph of survival rate by gender
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = Sex, fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Survival Rate by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Count")
📈 Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. You can explore the results by running the evaluation script after training the model.
